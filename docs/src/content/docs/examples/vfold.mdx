import { Showcase } from "../../../components/Showcase";
import { simulation } from "./vfold/example-simulation.js";
import simulationSource from "./vfold/example-simulation.js?raw";
import cardSource from "./vfold/card.js?raw";

This example places a "card" shape, which has two segments and a motorized fold.
Segment "b" is fixed to prevent the card from falling.

It then places a v-fold structure on top of the card and glues the glue pads
onto the card. The buttons below allow you to fold the card (i.e. set the position to
the fold motor)

## Showcase
