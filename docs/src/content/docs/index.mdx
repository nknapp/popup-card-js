  <Card title="Pop-up cards and maths">
    A couple of months ago, I discovered pop-up cards. I created one as a
    present to my niece and when researching it, I found [The Pop-Up
    Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@thepop-upchannel4919) on Youtube that give
    you nice introduction to techniques and patterns to build those. But event
    though many examples can be done without maths, in some cases, you need it.

  <Card title="Building blocks">
    My goal is to create a DSL to create building blocks for pop-up cards. It
    describes the unfolded 3D model of shapes, segments, folds and glue.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Visualize">
    Part of this library is to visualize such a model. Not just to show it in
    3D, but also to simulate the folding and unfolding of the card.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Build 2D templates">
    The other goal is to create 2D templates that can be printed and cut out to
    create the pop-up card.
